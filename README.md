**Joker’s Chaotic Chat — Project Documentation**

Overview
Joker’s Chaotic Chat is a web-based chatbot application themed around the Joker character. Users can interact with the chat interface, sending messages and receiving chaotic, Joker-style responses generated by a backend AI/chatbot logic.


Features
User-friendly chat interface with a Joker-themed design.


Real-time message sending and response display.


Backend API integration to generate chatbot replies.


Responsive design for desktop and mobile.


Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js (JavaScript, HTML, CSS)

Backend: Python (e.g., Flask/FastAPI with joker.py logic)

API Communication: RESTful POST requests sending user messages and receiving chatbot replies.



How It Works
User types a message into the chat input box.

Frontend sends the message to the backend API via an HTTP POST request.

Backend processes the input with Joker’s chatbot logic.

Backend returns a Joker-style response.

Frontend displays the response in the chat window.



Setup and Run
Backend
Wrap your joker.py chatbot logic in a Python API server (Flask/FastAPI).



Enable CORS for cross-origin requests.

Run the backend server (default port: 5000).



Frontend
Clone the React frontend repo.

Update the API endpoint URL in the frontend code to point to your backend server.

Run the React app (npm install and npm start).

How to Connect Frontend & Backend
Frontend sends user messages as JSON { message: "text" } to backend API.

Backend returns JSON { reply: "response" }.

Use fetch or axios in frontend to handle API calls.
